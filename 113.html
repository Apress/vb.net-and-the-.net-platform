<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>First of all, thanks for purchasing this text.  I honestly hope you have found it (and are finding it) enjoyable and informative.  As many of you may know, this book is a re-working of my first Apress title C# and the .NET Platform.  Given that the C# book has already gone through various Errata postings, it was very pleasing to find few errors in the VB.NET translation.  Nevertheless, I did find a few glitches that slipped into this first printing.  </p>

<p>This Errata page lists any goofs I have found in each chapter.  If you happen to find additional errors that have escaped my eyes, fell free to drop me a line and let me know!  You can reach me at:</p>

<h3>General Note</h3>

<p>The screen shots in Chapters 1, 2 and 3 are rather 'fuzzy'.  The good news is they are still readable (but it is rather annoying).  If you are having trouble reading the text in the images, do be aware that the same information is contained within the downloadable source code.  Sorry for the bother!</p>

<h3>Table of Contents </h3>

<p>Page viii.  The chapter title for chapter 7 is missing.  The second line has a Summary section for chapter 6, then goes right into listing the content for chapter 7 w/o listing the chapter title.</p>  

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>None.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>Page 52, table 2-2.  The "Web Control Library" row.  I say "As you see in Chapter 16, these GUI"  but should say "Chapter 15".</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<h4>Page 147</h4>

<p>Second paragraph.  Says "manner for any of the core system number".  Should say "manner for any of the core numerical number".</p>

<h4>Page 148</h4>

<p>Full paragraph on page, last sentence.  Says "Specifically, to make use of the members"  should say "of the shared members".</p>

<h4>Page 153</h4>

<p>Third paragraph.  First sentence says "Recall from chapter 2 that when".  Begin sentence simply with "When you create a brand" and remove the chapter 2 part.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<h4>Page 252</h4>

<p>First paragraph on page, first sentence.  Says "defines a static method" but should say "defines a shared method" (C# leftover).</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<h4>Page 267</h4>

<p>Code in middle of page.  The AboutToBlow() method has a parameter named 'msh' but needs to say 'msg' (change h to g).</p>

<h4>Page 274</h4>

<p>Second paragraph on page, second sentence.  Says "The AnyMethodWhichTakesAString delegate" but should say "The AnyMethodTakingAString delegate".</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>General: Be aware that under Beta2, the GAC sill mark ngen-ed assemblies with “PreJit”.  Under RC0 (released at the 2001 PDC) this has changed to read "Native Images").  Thus, any screen shots of the GAC should be mentally updated ;-)</p>

<h4>Page 370</h4>

<p>First paragraph says "(both static and shared)" but should say "(both instance level and shared)".</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

Page 403

<p>Table 8-3, row two, column two.  Says "method must set the method that is" should read "method to set the method that is".</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<h4>Page 490</h4>

<p>Second sentence at paragraph at bottom of page.  Says "This chapter wraps up by building an application".  Change this sentence to say "Now let's build an application that pulls together the information you have learned thus far." (It's not the last topic!)</p>

<h4>Page 493</h4>

<p>Table 9-25.  Change table heading from "Properties of the RegistryKey Type" to say "Members of the RegistryKey Type".</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<h4>Page 511</h4>

<p>Second full paragraph.  Remove final sentence completely ("Then, let's examine the set of basic utility types that are commonly used in GDI+ programming"). Somehow this got redundant.  </p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<h4>Page 648</h4>

<p>Final paragraph on page.  Says "As you recall from Chapter 8, " but should say Chapter 9.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<h4>Page 727</h4>

<p>Code.  5th line says:</p>

<p><pre>
Create DataColumn objects '
</pre></p>

<p>But the ' needs to be at the beginning like so:</p>

<p><pre>
' Create DataColumn objects
</pre></p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<h4>Page 740</h4>

<p>Table 13-2, title of second column says SYSTEM TYPES but need to be singular (SYSTEM TYPE).</p>

<h3>Chapter 14, 15, 16</h3>

<p>No changes!</p>
